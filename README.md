# BBC-News-Classification
This project involves classifying BBC news articles into one of five categories (business, sports, politics, technology, or entertainment). 
ou will be expected to clean and preprocess the
data, perform exploratory analysis, and build a machine learning or deep learning model for text
classification making it a multiclass classification problem.
Students are encouraged to explore model optimization and fine-tuning techniques using
frameworks like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, Transformer or PyTorch.
Dataset: The BBC News Dataset contains 2,225 articles from the BBC news website corresponding
to stories in five topical areas from 2004-2005. The articles are categorized into five topics:
business, sports, politics, technology, and entertainment.

Instructions
7. Data Preprocessing:
o Read data
o cleaning the data (lowercase all the texts, remove punctuation marks, all the
symbol, ...)
o show how many categories are available in the dataset
8. Exploratory Analysis
o To begin this exploratory analysis, first use matplotlib to import libraries and define
functions for plotting the data. Depending on the data, not all plots will be made.
9. Feature Extraction
You can either use one of the methods to convert the text data into numerical features that a model
can process.
o Bag-of-Words (BoW)
o TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
o Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText
o Pretrained transformer Transformers (e.g., BERT, GPT)
10. Model selection:
o Different machine learning and deep learning models can be used:
Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest or
XGBoost Can be used with BoW or TF-IDF features.
▪ Deep Learning (RNNs, CNNs)
▪ Transformers (BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT)
▪ Also, you must apply different models and compare the results.
11. Evaluation Metrics:
o Extend the evaluation metrics to include:
▪ Confusion matrix
▪ Precision, Recall, and F1-score for a more detailed analysis of the model
performance, especially since this is a binary classification task.
12. Model Training:
o Train the model on the training split and validate on the development test split.
o Plot the training and validation accuracy/loss curves over the training epochs.
Experimenting with different models like BERT or SVMs to see which performs best on your dataset.
